# Legacy Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical planning documents and deprecated configurations from the project's development phase.

## Contents

### Planning Documents (`planning/`)
All sprint planning, analysis, and implementation tracking documents that guided the unification of agent-x and x-agent into the current unified implementation.

**Key Documents:**
- `UNIFICATION_PLAN.md` — Original plan for merging both agents (completed)
- `SPRINT_2_BACKLOG.md` — Sprint 2 backlog items
- Analysis files: AGILE, AUTONOMY, CURRENT_STATE, REPOSITORY
- Implementation summaries: IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY
- Feature docs: READ_BUDGET_IMPLEMENTATION, MIGRATION, OBSERVABILITY

All work described in these documents has been completed and integrated into the current `src/` implementation.
