## Completed Work

### Phase 2: Extract Business Logic (Non-Breaking) ✅

**Commit:** `e71ac27`

#### Created Files:
- **`src/business/__init__.py`** (3 lines) - Module init with exports
  - Exports: `TEMPLATES`, `REPLY_TEMPLATES`, `choose_template`, `make_post`, `helpful_reply`
  - Exports: `should_act_on_post`, `filter_eligible_actions`

- **`src/business/content.py`** (95 lines) - Content generation and template management
  - Moved `TEMPLATES` dict (4 topics × 4 templates each)
  - Moved `REPLY_TEMPLATES` list (6 engagement reply templates)
  - Moved `choose_template(topic)` - Random template selection with fallback
  - Moved `make_post(topic, slot, allow_media)` - Generates post text
  - Moved `helpful_reply(base_text)` - Random reply generation
  - Added comprehensive docstrings

- **`src/business/filters.py`** (47 lines) - Post and action filtering logic
  - `should_act_on_post(post_id, author_id, me_user_id)` - Self-post filter with type conversion
  - `filter_eligible_actions(post_id, actions, quotas)` - Quota-based action filtering
  - Added comprehensive docstrings

- **`tests/test_business_content.py`** (129 lines) - 13 test cases
  - Template structure validation (all topics present, non-empty)
  - Reply templates structure
  - `choose_template`: known topics, unknown topics (fallback), randomness
  - `make_post`: basic, with media flag (placeholder), tuple return
  - `helpful_reply`: basic, with base_text (unused), randomness
  - Quality checks: topic variety (≥3 templates), reply variety (≥5), length limits (<280 chars)
  - Coverage: 100%

- **`tests/test_business_filters.py`** (132 lines) - 13 test cases
  - `should_act_on_post`: non-self posts, self-post filtering, None author handling, type conversion
  - `filter_eligible_actions`: full quota, partial exhaustion, full exhaustion, empty inputs, missing keys, negative quotas, order preservation
  - Edge cases: empty strings, numeric IDs
  - Coverage: 100%

#### Modified Files:
- **`src/actions.py`** (103 lines, reduced from 158)
  - Removed `TEMPLATES`, `REPLY_TEMPLATES` (moved to `business.content`)
  - Removed `choose_template`, `make_post`, `helpful_reply` (moved to `business.content`)
  - Added imports: `from business.content import ...`, `from business.filters import ...`
  - Added `__all__` for backward compatibility exports
  - `act_on_search()` now calls `should_act_on_post()` instead of inline self-check
  - Preserved all orchestration logic, jitter, storage integration
  - Coverage: 98.51% (1 line: graceful degradation edge case)

#### Test Results:
```
535 passed, 2 skipped in 32.49s
Coverage: 97.82% (exceeds 97% requirement)
```

All existing 509 tests still pass. New tests add 26 cases. Business layer has 100% coverage.

#### Architecture Changes:
- ✅ Business logic separated from orchestration
- ✅ Content generation isolated in `business.content`
- ✅ Filtering logic isolated in `business.filters`
- ✅ `actions.py` now delegates to business layer
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained via re-exports
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code

### Phase 1: Extract API Layer (Non-Breaking)

**Commit:** `8286b50`

#### Created Files:
- **`src/api/__init__.py`** - Module init with exports
- **`src/api/client.py`** (138 lines) - Low-level HTTP client
  - GET/POST/DELETE methods
  - Dry-run support
  - Auth-agnostic (takes headers from caller)
  - Integrates with `reliability.request_with_retries`
  
- **`src/api/endpoints.py`** (93 lines) - Centralized URL construction
  - All X API v2 endpoints (users, posts, engagement, search)
  - v1.1 media upload endpoint
  - Static methods for type safety
  
- **`tests/test_api_client.py`** (141 lines) - 8 test cases
  - Dry-run behavior (GET/POST/DELETE)
  - Live mode with mocked retries
  - Error handling (missing requests library)
  - Coverage: 94.12% (2 lines: import fallback)
  
- **`tests/test_api_endpoints.py`** (69 lines) - 14 test cases
  - All endpoint URL construction
  - Coverage: 100%
  
- **`docs/roadmap/MODULARIZATION_INVENTORY.md`** - Complete architecture plan
  - Current state analysis (x_client.py 533 lines, actions.py 158 lines)
  - Proposed module structure (api/, business/, orchestration/)
  - Migration strategy (4 phases)
  - Test coverage plan
  - Open questions and decisions

#### Test Results:
```
509 passed, 2 skipped in 28.75s
```

All existing tests still pass. New tests add 22 cases.

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. API Layer Responsibilities
- ✅ HTTP communication (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ✅ Dry-run printing
- ✅ Error handling (requests library check)
- ❌ Auth logic (stays in `UnifiedAuth`, passed as headers)
- ❌ Rate limiting (stays with `reliability` module)
- ❌ Telemetry spans (will be in orchestration layer)

### 2. Endpoints Pattern
- Static methods for compile-time safety
- Template-style URL construction (no f-strings in business logic)
- Separation of v2 and v1.1 base URLs

### 3. Non-Breaking Extraction
- No changes to `x_client.py` yet (facade intact)
- No changes to `actions.py` yet
- No changes to `main.py` yet
- All tests pass without modification

---

## Next Steps: Phase 2

## Next Steps: Phase 3

### Extract Orchestration Layer (Breaking)

**Status:** Ready to begin

1. **Create `src/orchestration/actions.py`**
  - Move `act_on_search()` from current `actions.py`
  - Move `dry_run_post()` (orchestration logic)
  - Move orchestration-specific imports (storage, x_client, budget)
  - Add comprehensive unit tests

2. **Update `src/main.py` to use new orchestration layer**
  - Update imports: `from orchestration.actions import ...`
  - This is a BREAKING change (requires main.py modification)
  - Verify scheduler integration still works

3. **Deprecate old `src/actions.py`**
  - Add deprecation warnings to re-exported functions
  - Keep file for one release cycle for backward compatibility
  - Document migration path in docstrings

4. **Add test coverage**
  - `tests/test_orchestration_actions.py`
  - Verify all existing action tests still pass with new imports

### Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

---

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Final Validation

**Status:** Pending Phase 3 completion

1. **Remove deprecated `src/actions.py`**
  - Ensure all code migrated to new structure
  - Remove backward compatibility re-exports

2. **Final documentation update**
  - Update README.md with new architecture
  - Update QUICKSTART.md import examples
  - Create ARCHITECTURE.md documenting module responsibilities

3. **Create Pull Request**
  - Summary of all 4 phases
  - Test results (coverage, regression checks)
  - Migration guide for any external consumers

### Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours

---

## Open Questions for Phase 2+

### Q1: Pydantic models for API layer?
**Decision:** Defer to future issue (not blocking).  
Rationale: Would add dependency and migration effort; current dict-based approach works.

### Q2: Keep `actions.py` as facade or deprecate?
**Decision:** Deprecate in Phase 3.  
Rationale: Clearer import paths; signals "orchestration is the new pattern."

### Q3: Telemetry spans at API layer or orchestration only?
**Decision:** Both layers.  
Rationale: API spans for low-level HTTP; orchestration spans for workflows.
